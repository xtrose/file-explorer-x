File Explorer X is a new generation of file managers for Windows Mobile.
The file management app provides two windows that make it easy to drag and drop files.
The File Manager 2016 is ahead of its time and offers more possibilities like many similar apps on other mobile systems.
The app is multitasking capable and can process data in multiple operations at once.
For different views, the app also provides support for memory cards, One Drive and Dropbox.
The app was developed in uwp format and is also available for Windows.
Unfortunately, the limitations, on the part of the system, were so severe at the time that the app is not really usable on Windows.

The app managed more than 500,000 downloads in its time, for Windows Mobile alone, and is still one of the top apps in the store.
